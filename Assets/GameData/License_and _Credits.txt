	The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
	redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
	fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,

	to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

	writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
